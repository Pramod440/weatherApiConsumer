About :
           This project is a simple Java console application that fetches real-time weather data using a public REST API.It demonstrates how to make HTTP GET requests and parse JSON responses using Java.
The application uses the Open-Meteo API, which provides free weather data without requiring an API key.Key libraries used are OkHttp for HTTP communication and Jackson for JSON parsing.The current temperature,
wind speed, and time are displayed in a structured format.This project helps understand how to interact with web services using Java.It is ideal for internships or beginners exploring RESTful APIs in Java.
No frontend is included, keeping the focus on backend logic.
